                <h3>
                    Good day to you from wherever you are seeing this, Trust you're still holding up
                    with life up's and down's?...</h3> <br>
                <p>I'm Njoga Praise by name, graduated from Ayedere high school, and am aspiring to further my education in UNIBEN. I'm from Enugu-State, But as I have said before I'am currently based in Lagos-State, Nigeria.
                    I like playing football, basketball, table tenis, swimming and musical instruments.
                    <br>

                    I have a splash of all 4 temperaments except saguine, kinda friendly and also multi-talented.
                    <br><br>

                    I'm also very Creative in all my endeavors and I think and process my thoughts logically and quickly,
                    I started out my career as a Fullstack developer since 2020, started Backend development since 2021, which naturally makes me <b>Backend heavy</b> (i.e I work more on backend), and trust me when I say that
                    It hasn't really been a smooth journey all through,
                    but all thanks still to God, family, and friends. <br>
                    Nothing comes easy even with or without the help of God hope you know?....well thats a discussion
                    for when we meet, lol. Do enjoy your stay here.
